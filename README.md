## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a **blueprint or skeletal framework** of a website or application.  
It focuses on the **layout, structure, and arrangement of elements** rather than colors, graphics, or visual design.

## Importance of Wireframing

- **Clarifies Layout and Structure:** Helps visualize the placement of content and functionality.  
- **Facilitates Communication:** Serves as a common reference for designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- **Identifies Usability Issues Early:** Enables testing and feedback before detailed design or development begins.  
- **Saves Time and Cost:** Reduces the need for major changes later in the design or development process.
## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes are made up of several important elements that define the structure and usability of a website or application:

1. **Layout Structure**  
   - Defines the **arrangement of elements** on each page.  
   - Example: Placing a header, sidebar, and main content area in a clear and consistent way ensures users can navigate easily.

2. **Navigation**  
   - Shows how users **move through the system**.  
   - Example: Menus, tabs, and buttons guide users to key sections like Home, Search, and Profile.

3. **Content Placement**  
   - Determines **where text, images, and media** appear on the page.  
   - Example: Highlighting property images above descriptions in a booking app makes information more accessible.

4. **Functionality**  
   - Indicates **interactive elements and system behavior**.  
   - Example: Buttons for booking, dropdowns for selecting dates, and forms for user input help define how the system works.
