# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a **blueprint or skeletal framework** of a website or application.  
It focuses on the **layout, structure, and arrangement of elements** rather than colors, graphics, or visual design.

## Importance of Wireframing

- **Clarifies Layout and Structure:** Helps visualize the placement of content and functionality.  
- **Facilitates Communication:** Serves as a common reference for designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- **Identifies Usability Issues Early:** Enables testing and feedback before detailed design or development begins.  
- **Saves Time and Cost:** Reduces the need for major changes later in the design or development process.
