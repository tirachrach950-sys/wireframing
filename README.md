# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a **blueprint or skeletal framework** of a website or application.  
It focuses on the **layout, structure, and arrangement of elements** rather than colors, graphics, or visual design.

## Importance of Wireframing

- **Clarifies Layout and Structure:** Helps visualize the placement of content and functionality.  
- **Facilitates Communication:** Serves as a common reference for designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- **Identifies Usability Issues Early:** Enables testing and feedback before detailed design or development begins.  
- **Saves Time and Cost:** Reduces the need for major changes later in the design or development process.
## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes are made up of several important elements that define the structure and usability of a website or application:

1. **Layout Structure**  
   - Defines the **arrangement of elements** on each page.  
   - Example: Placing a header, sidebar, and main content area in a clear and consistent way ensures users can navigate easily.
## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes can be categorized into **Low-Fidelity** and **High-Fidelity** depending on the level of detail and visual refinement.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Definition:** Simple, rough sketches of a website or app layout.  
- **Purpose:** Focuses on structure, layout, and placement of elements without detailed graphics, colors, or typography.  
- **When Used:** Early stages of design to quickly explore ideas and gather feedback.  
- **Example:** A hand-drawn sketch or a basic digital wireframe showing where headers, content, and buttons go.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Definition:** Detailed, polished wireframes that include colors, typography, spacing, and sometimes interactive elements.  
- **Purpose:** Represents a more realistic view of the final product and helps in usability testing.  
- **When Used:** Later stages of design when refining layout, flow, and user interactions.  
- **Example:** Digital wireframe in Figma with precise alignment, detailed components, and realistic content placeholders.

### Wireframe Type for This Project
For this wireframing project, we are creating **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**, focusing on layout, structure, navigation, and content placement rather than visual design details.

2. **Navigation**  
   - Shows how users **move through the system**.  
   - Example: Menus, tabs, and buttons guide users to key sections like Home, Search, and Profile.

3. **Content Placement**  
   - Determines **where text, images, and media** appear on the page.  
   - Example: Highlighting property images above descriptions in a booking app makes information more accessible.

4. **Functionality**  
   - Indicates **interactive elements and system behavior**.  
   - Example: Buttons for booking, dropdowns for selecting dates, and forms for user input help define how the system works.
## Wireframing Tools

There are several tools available for creating wireframes, ranging from simple sketching apps to advanced design software. Choosing the right tool can improve efficiency and collaboration during the design process.

### Popular Wireframing Tools:
- **Figma:**  
  - Cloud-based design tool with real-time collaboration.  
  - Allows designers to create wireframes, prototypes, and UI designs.  
  - Features include components, grids, constraints, and interactive elements.  
  - Useful for both low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes.  

- **Adobe XD:** Enables wireframing and prototyping with interactive elements.  
- **Sketch:** A macOS tool for wireframing, UI design, and prototyping.  
- **Balsamiq:** Focuses on low-fidelity wireframes with a han
